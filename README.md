## How does it work?

It uses Astro Content Collections just like we use `settings.yml`, `content.yml` and `faqs.yml`.

This means every collection is treated as an entrypoint in the CMS.

The necessary config to integrate this is done at `astro.config.mjs`.

## How does config work?

Inside `astro.config.mjs` at `export default defineConfig({ integrations: [...] )}` we need to set:

```
NetlifyCMS({
      config: {
        backend: {
          name: 'git-gateway',
          branch: 'master',
        },
        collections: [
            {
                name: 'Cities',
                label: 'Cities Content',
                folder: 'src/content/city',
                filter: {field: "filter", value: "city"},
                create: true,
                delete: true,
                slug: "{{fields.name}}",
                fields: [
                    { name: 'name', widget: 'string', label: 'City Name' },
                    { name: 'language', widget: 'string', label: 'Language' },
                    { name: 'info', widget: 'markdown', label: 'City Info' }
                ],
            },
        ],
      },
    }),

```
We can see two main properties, backend and collections. We will take a look the options inside collecitons:

The main options we have to consider are `create: true`, `delete: true` and `slug: "{{fields.name}}"`. Create and Delete properties allow us to enable/disable item creation inside the collection, and slug works just like field summary we have been using in `landings-cms > landing-* > config.json`.

We have also set `filter: {field: "filter", value: "city"}` as a workaround to use nested content-collections which is not a possible option by default. By default we would have needed to set manually all possible collections. Let's see what nested collections can look like:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ city/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ en/
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ madrid.md
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ fr/
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ paris.md
```

Finally, fields property is an array of objects with the default NetlifyCMS options we know `name: ...`, `label: ...` ...
Be careful to set the same name in fields config to the field in markdown.

## How are new collections created?

If `create: true`, users will be able to add new items inside a collection.

By setting a slug just like mentioned before, we can set field value as file name.

## How are changes made?

This works as expected, the value from the modified field is updated. In workflow by default we have three options:

```
- Publish now
- Publish and create new
- Publish and duplicate
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
